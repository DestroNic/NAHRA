    <h4>Our Beginnings</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="history-detail">
  <p>
    NAHRA was born out of the need to coordinate efforts to assist Nicaraguan refugees seeking asylum in the United States and in other countries in the Americas. The deportation of 60 Nicaraguans in early 2019 that had fled the country escaping persecution evidenced the need for a structured approach to the Nicaraguan immigration and humanitarian crisis.
    In February of 2019 over 30 independent volunteers and members of different organizations who were working on various issues related to the Nicaraguan crisis met in Washington D.C. Sharing experiences of support for cases in different countries, we realized the magnitude of the issue and the importance of continuing to work at the national level under the umbrella of one organization. As a result, we elaborated an action plan and strategy to cooperate and unite our efforts.
    NAHRA was formally registered as a non-profit organization in Washington D.C. in May of 2019.
